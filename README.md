# SP-2
SP for me is tasks of easy and small projects for the purpose of learning. Most often, they are based on Frontend Mentor projects.

In this mini project I created a responsive product card. When creating it, I paid attention to compatibility with other browsers (the previous one had a problem with graphics in Safari). Thanks to SASS, I used the mixin function for the first time.

Here's a link to Frontend Mentor where I downloaded the illustrations and got the idea. https://www.frontendmentor.io.
